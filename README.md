## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Description: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
   - Usage: To predict continuous values based on input features.
   
2. **Decision Tree**
   - Description: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
   - Usage: Suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
   
3. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Description: An unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into clusters based on similarity.
   - Usage: Effective for clustering data into distinct groups.

## Installation
